## ❤️ Motivation

What I don't like about `PhotoKit` is that it's *not declarative* and that developers have to *think about too many details*.
That's why I created this Swift package which will dramatically *improve the readability* of your `PhotoKit` code.

Easily fetch media from the photo library with `Albums.all`, `album.photos` or `Photos.live` and many more.

Additionally you can perform many operations on the photo library in a very easy and robust way, like

- changing the *favorite* state of a media object,
- fetching metadata or
- deleting media
- ...

Check out the below **API** section for more.

**And please feel free to contribute.** **Any kind of contribution is more than welcome!** I can guarantee you that even with a good unit test coverage there are still bugs hiding somewhere 🐛.

## ℹ️ Installation

Just add this Swift package as a dependency to your `Package.swift`

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/crelies/Media.git", from: "0.1.0"),
```

## 📖 Implementation

This Swift package provides its functionality through wrapper types for many common `PhotoKit` media types:

- Album(s)
- Audio(s)
- LivePhoto(s)
- (Media.)Photo(s)
- Video(s)

Many types implement static factory methods to make it easy for the developer to access and manage the photo library.

In addition to that this Swift package contains some simple and ready-to-use **SwiftUI views** for interacting with the photo library, like a `Camera` view or a view for an instance of  `LivePhoto`, `Photo` and `Video`.

The core functionality is available through `import MediaCore`. If you want to use the included **SwiftUI** views `import MediaSwiftUI` as well.

That's all you need to know. Now let's take a look at the **API**.

## 🧭 API
